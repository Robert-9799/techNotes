## symmetric positive semidefinite

1. [Proof of a matrix is positive semidefinite iff it can be written in the form Xâ€²X](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/482688/proof-of-a-matrix-is-positive-semidefinite-iff-it-can-be-written-in-the-form-x)

## Can matrix exponentials be negative?

Refer to [Can matrix exponentials ever be negative? If so, under what conditions?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/926943/can-matrix-exponentials-ever-be-negative-if-so-under-what-conditions).

One argument: if the matrix to have non-negative entries off-diagonal, then the matrix exponentials must be positive.
