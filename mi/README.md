# install GApps for Mi Pad 2

[solutions](http://en.miui.com/thread-318884-1-1.html)

1. download and install [Google Services Framework](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-services-framework/google-services-framework-5-1-1743759-release/google-services-framework-5-1-1743759-android-apk-download/download/), pay attention to the version of android. For me, I need to download the apk whose vesion is 4.4.4, rather than the apk in the reference web page.
2. download and install [Google Account Manager](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-account-manager/google-account-manager-4-4-4-1227136-release/google-account-manager-4-4-4-1227136-android-apk-download/), also need to pay attention the version
3. download and install [Google Play services](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-services/google-play-services-11-7-43-release/google-play-services-11-7-43-070-172403884-android-apk-download/download/), it is necessary to differ the CPU Architecture no matter what the version it is.
4. download and install [Google Play Store](https://www.apkmirror.com/?post_type=app_release&searchtype=apk&s=Google+Play+Store), you can pick the latest version and do not worry about the version or CPU Architecture.


After you've installed these four APK's, then go to settings -> autostart -> add autostart apps and "allow" these 4 installed apps (exactly only the 2 services is also sufficient). After that restart your tablet and start Play Store and enjoy!
